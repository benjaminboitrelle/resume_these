abstract = {In the Standard Model (SM) the couplings of the Higgs boson to SM particles and itself (self-couplings) are uniquely specified once the masses of the particles in question as well as the Higgs boson mass are given. Precision measurements of these couplings in the future collider experi-ments are the key to either verifying the mechanism of the electroweak symmetry breaking in the SM or uncovering physics beyond the SM. This article gives an overview of how various Higgs couplings will be measured at the ILC. Emphasis is put on the ILC's capability of performing fully model independent determination of absolute HZZ and HWW couplings, the Higgs total width, and hence various other Higgs couplings, which cover essentially all the crucial ones in-cluding the top-Yukawa coupling Htt and the trilinear Higgs self-coupling $\lambda$ HHH . The strategy to get the best precision measurements at the ILC is through staged running, which provides many independent $\sigma$ Ã— Br measurements for different production channels and at different energies. A method of global fitting is discussed to utilize all of the available information and to derive combined precisions.},

abstract = {The ILC Higgs White Paper is a review of Higgs Boson theory and experiment at the International Linear Collider (ILC). Theory topics include the Standard Model Higgs, the two-Higgs doublet model, alternative approaches to electroweak symmetry breaking, and precision goals for Higgs boson experiments. Experimental topics include the measurement of the Higgs cross section times branching ratio for various Higgs decay modes at ILC center of mass energies of 250, 500, and 1000 GeV, and the extraction of Higgs couplings and the total Higgs width from these measurements. Luminosity scenarios based on the ILC TDR machine design are used throughout. The gamma-gamma collider option at the ILC is also discussed.},
